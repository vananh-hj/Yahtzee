					-How to Play Yahtzee-
________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This Yahtzee game is a 1 player game. It consists of 13 rounds. 
In each round, you roll up to 5 dice with the Roll Em button. You can roll up to 3 times, 
choosing which die to roll or keep by checking or unchecking the "Roll" checkboxes. 
You can score after any "Roll Em" button click the roll. Once you score, a new round starts. 
You score in one of 13 categories. You must score once in each category -- which means that 
towards the end of the game you may have to settle for scoring zero in some categories. 
The score is determined by a different rule for each category; see the section on Scoring below.
The object of the game is to maximize your total score. The game ends once all 13 categories 
have been scored. 

					*Rolling the Dice*
 To start with, you roll all dice by clicking on the Roll Em button. After you roll all dice, 
you can either score the current roll, or re-roll any or all of the five dice. 
To re-roll some of the dice, click on the toggle button underneath the die face you want to re-roll, 
then click on the Roll Em 1/3 button. This will re-roll the selected dice, leaving the unselected 
ones unchanged. 
You can roll the dice a total of three times -- the initial roll (in which you must roll all the dice), 
plus two re-rolls of any or all dice. After rolling three times, you must score the roll. 
Once you've scored the roll, you roll all the dice again and repeat the process. 
You continue until all 13 categories have been filled, at which time the game is over.

					==Scoring==
Once you have the dice face combination you want to score, you score the roll in one of the 13 
categories. You do this by clicking on one of the radio buttons in either the Upper Section or 
Lower Section box. Once a category has been scored, it is closed out for the rest of the game; 
you cannot change a category's score once it's been set. Each category defines its own scoring rules, 
as described below. 

					*Upper Scores*

In the upper scores, you total only the specified die face. 
	When the game is over, if you score 63 or more upper points, you will get an Upper Section Bonus 
of 35 points. The Total Score in this section is the sum of the Upper Section scores and Upper Section
Bonus. 

					*Lower Scores*

In the lower scores, you score either a set amount (defined by the category), or zero if you don't 
satisfy the category requirements. 

					=3 and 4 of a Kind=
For 3 of a Kind, you must have at least three of the same die faces. If so, you get the total all the die 
faces and score that total. Similarly for 4 of a Kind, except that you must have 4 of the 5 die 
faces the same. 
					=Straights=
Like in poker, a straight is a sequence of consecutive die faces; a small straight (sequence of 4) 
is 4 consecutive faces and scores 30 points. A large straight (sequence of 5) is 5 consecutive faces
is 40 points.  
					=Full House=
Again as in poker, a Full House is a roll where you have both a 3 of a kind, and a pair. Full houses 
score 25 points. 
					=Yahtzee=
A Yahtzee is a 5 of a Kind (i.e. all the die faces are the same), and it scores 50 points. If you 
roll more than one Yahtzee in a single game, you will earn a 100 point bonus for each additional 
Yahtzee roll, provided that you have already scored a 50 in the Yahtzee category. If you have not 
scored in the Yahtzee category, you will not receive a bonus. If you have scored a zero in the Yahtzee 
category, you cannot receive any bonuses during the current game.

					=Chance=
Chance is the catch-all roll. You can roll anything and you simply total all the die faces values. 

Grand Total is the sum of Upper and Lower Sections and any applicable bonuses.
